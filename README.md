📊 CTR Prediction using Machine Learning
🚀 Project Overview

Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a core task in digital advertising, where the goal is to estimate the probability that a user will click on an advertisement.
This project uses machine learning models to predict CTR and optimize ad targeting, which helps advertisers reduce costs and increase ROI.

🎯 Objectives

Understand user behavior and engagement with online ads
Build a machine learning model to predict the probability of a click
Improve ad spend efficiency by targeting high CTR users
Compare different ML algorithms for performance

🗂️ Dataset
Source: Criteo CTR Dataset
 (or any CTR dataset you used)

Size: Millions of rows with categorical and numerical features

Features:
User-related features (age, device, region, etc.)
Ad-related features (ad ID, campaign ID, category, etc.)
Contextual features (time, placement, etc.)

Target Variable:

1 → User clicked the ad
0 → User did not click
